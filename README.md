# scummvm-android
Docker Image configuration and auxiliary files for NDK r14b toolchains for building the ScummVM port for Android

Based on the work of Colin Snover (csnover), Cameron Cawley (ccawley2011) and Le Philousophe (lephilousophe).

Todo: 
- Properly fill in documentation here for users
- Add separate building script for arm-v7a apks
- Test adding support for more third party libraries 
- Test possible transition to building with gradle without losing minimum API support
