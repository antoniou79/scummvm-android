Rules in this directory are automatically included by compile-libraries.sh and
are used to override the default `apt-get source` + `configure` + `make install`
operation when building a library from source.

Variables available to rules:

$host     - The host tuple of the target host.
$library  - The name of the source library.
$num_cpus - The ideal number of compilation threads.
$prefix   - The prefix for the target host.

Functions available to rules:

do_configure(...)     - Call `configure` with default flags, plus any extra
                        passed flags
do_fetch()            - Remove any old source directory and fetch fresh source
                        code for the library from apt
do_make()             - Call `make -j<num_cpus> install`
get_dependencies(...) - Build dependencies to retrieve from apt
warning(...)          - Print the passed message to stderr
